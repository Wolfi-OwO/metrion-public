/**
 * Read handlers. Both are mounted behind `resolveProjectIds` then
 * `validateQuery` (`routes/metrics.routes.ts`), so `req.projectIds` and
 * `req.query` are already resolved and range-checked here - a handler that
 * re-derived either would be a second place for it to drift out of sync with
 * the middleware that owns it.
 *
 * `req.projectIds` is read here and nowhere in `metrics.schemas.ts`, on
 * purpose: it is never a query parameter a caller could set, only something
 * the route layer injects (see `middlewares/project-scope.ts`). `?projectId=`
 * IS a query parameter, but it only ever narrows `req.projectIds` down to one
 * of its own entries - `scopeProjectIds` is what enforces that, here rather
 * than in the schema, because "is this one of mine" needs the session-derived
 * list, not just the string's shape.
