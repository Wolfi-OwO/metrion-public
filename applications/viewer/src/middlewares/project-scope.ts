/**
 * The seam issue #7 (OAuth accounts / sessions, Task 6) replaces.
 *
 * Before this task there was no session system, so nothing here could
 * resolve "the caller's own projects" from anything real - `req.projectIds`
 * came from one swappable resolver function defaulting to "no projects",
 * the safe failure direction for a scoping bug. That default is gone:
 * `setProjectIdsResolver` below is now called (from `main.ts`) with
 * `resolveProjectIdsFromSession`, which reads the session cookie, resolves
 * it to a user, and lists that user's own projects - an anonymous caller
 * (no cookie, or an invalid one) still resolves to `[]`, so
 * `GET /api/v1/metrics` stays a public endpoint that simply has nothing to
 * show an unauthenticated caller, rather than requiring a session outright.
 *
 * `metrics-service.ts` takes `projectIds` as a plain parameter and never
 * reads a query parameter or session itself, so plugging in the real
 * resolver was the only thing that needed to change - nothing from routes
 * down to the SQL moved.
 *
 * `tests/metrics.test.ts` still uses `setProjectIdsResolver` directly to seed
 * the two-project leakage proof its acceptance criteria call for, overriding
 * the real resolver in-process rather than standing up a real session for
 * every test - the seam this task built on remains useful as a test hook
 * even now that a real implementation exists.
