# One-shot loader: COPYs scripts/uptime-backfill/transform.mjs's output TSV
# into Metrion's `metrics` hypertable over SSH, bypassing the ingest service
# (issue #5's clock-skew guard rejects timestamps older than ~48h, so 90
# days of history cannot go through POST /api/v1/ingest). See README.md for
# the full three-stage procedure this is stage (L) of.
#
# NOT idempotent by design, on purpose: `metrics` is a hypertable of samples
# with no unique constraint and no natural key, so a second run doubles
# every row with no way to tell the copies apart afterwards. This script
# refuses to load if backfill-range data already exists for the given
# project (see the guard query below) — a re-run needs an explicit DELETE
# first, documented in README.md.
#
# The guard is PER-RESOURCE and bounded by each resource's own live-cutoff
# (live-cutoffs.json, the same file transform.mjs reads), not a flat
# "any uptime.* row for this project" check: Task 26's dual-write has been
# writing real uptime.* rows to this exact project since before this backfill
# ever runs, so a flat check would find those live rows and refuse to run on
# the very first (and every) attempt. Checking only the backfill's own time
# range (strictly before each resource's live cutoff) distinguishes "this
# backfill already ran" from "the live writer is doing its job" correctly.
