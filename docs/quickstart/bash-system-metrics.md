# Quickstart: bash

The absolute minimum way to get real numbers off a box and into metrion:
`/proc`, `df`, and `curl`. No SDK, no runtime to install, no library to pin -
just the shell commands most machines already have. This is one of the
per-language quickstart pages (issue #10 adds the rest); this page stands on
its own.

It POSTs a **bare array of metric points** - the plain
`{name, value, unit, timestamp, interval}` shape, with no `resource` wrapper
at all. The ingest service fills in `resource` from the project's own
`default_resource` (see `docs/adr/0005-api-key-determines-tenancy.md`), so a
sender that only ever reports for one project never has to know or send its
own name.

## The script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Where the ingest service listens and the API key it should bill this data
# to. mtr_<prefix>_<secret> - never commit a real one; generate a project and
# a key first (see the ingest service's own README once issue #7's
# account/project API exists - until then, seed one directly, the same way
# applications/ingest/tests/ingest.test.ts does).
INGEST_URL="${INGEST_URL:-http://localhost:8090}"
API_KEY="${API_KEY:-mtr_REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_PREFIX_REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SECRET}"

# --- CPU%: two /proc/stat samples one second apart -------------------------
# Line 1 is the aggregate "cpu" line: user nice system idle iowait irq softirq
# steal guest guest_nice (man proc(5)). "busy" is everything that isn't idle
# or iowait; usage% is the busy delta over the total delta between samples -
# a single snapshot cannot give a rate, only a cumulative counter since boot.

cpu_percent() {
  local a b idle_a idle_b total_a total_b busy_a busy_b

## Running it

```bash
cp the script above into system-metrics.sh, chmod +x it, then:
INGEST_URL=http://localhost:8090 API_KEY=mtr_<prefix>_<secret> ./system-metrics.sh
```

A successful call answers `202` with `{"accepted":1,"points":3}` - one
(synthetic) envelope, three points. Run it from cron or a systemd timer once
a minute for continuous reporting; `applications/agent` is the same idea
built out into a real long-running collector once bash stops being enough
(container stats, request logs, a retry queue for outages).

## What this deliberately does not do

- No retry, no local queue - a failed POST here is just lost. `applications/agent`'s
  on-disk `SampleQueue` is the upgrade path once losing a minute's sample on a
  network blip starts to matter.
- No `resource`/`subResource` - this is the bare-array shape specifically to
  exercise (and demonstrate) the project's `default_resource` fallback. Send
  an enveloped body instead if a sender reports for more than one resource.
